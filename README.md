# arpg-shop

Inventory shop for your A-RPG items  
[Live](https://arpg-shop-production.up.railway.app/)
This is a skeleton app where you can add item categories and items
Will be updated/better styled along the way
For now I understood how to:

1. Create Routes with express.Router()
2. Design and write Schemas with Mongoose (models)
3. Export controllers for GET/POST HTTP requests
4. Manipulate data within the Views from Pug
